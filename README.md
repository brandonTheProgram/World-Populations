# World-Populations

Mapping Global Data Sets: JSON Format using Pygal as guided by Eric Matthews' book Python Crash Course. The included files include a map for population, states/districts/providences/parishes, GDP, and GPP that was generated by modifying the code slightly. The code presented is currently the one to generate a map on population. I included the other files to show you what it would look like to change the code around for other data stuctures.
