# World-Populations

Mapping Global Data Sets: JSON Format using Pygal as guided by Eric Matthews' book Python Crash Course. The included files include a map for population, GDP, and GPP that was generated by modifying the code slightly. The code presented is currently the one to generate a map on population. I included the other files to show you what it would look like to change the code around.

# Steps-to-use

To use:

  • Download the project
  
  • Open the svg file which bring up the interactive map on your browser 
  
  • To regenerate the map, open the world_atlas.py file then open the html link that is created
